# CITS1401-Project2

This project it was quite similar to project 1, however we had to try and handle the errors and terminate the program gracefully if something was wrong with the data in the CSV file. I was required to write a computer program that can read the data from a CSV (comma-separated values) file and return different analytical results.

The PDF in this repository contains the instructions of what the project involved.
